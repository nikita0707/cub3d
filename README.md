# cub3D

This is the cub3D project from the new cursus.

In this project i implemented simple raycasting game engine on C. With simple level editor and basic mechanics.

For rendering, I used the minilibx library.

Main part:
- [x] Raycasting
- [x] Moving
- [x] Textures on walls
- [x] Sprites

Bonus part:
- [x] Wall collisions.
- [x] A skybox.
- [x] Floor and/or ceiling texture.
- [x] An HUD.
- [x] Ability to look up and down.
- [x] Jump or crouch.
- [x] A distance related shadow effect.
- [x] Life bar.
- [x] More items in the maze.
- [x] Object collisions.
- [x] Earning points and/or losing life by picking up objects/traps.
- [x] Doors which can open and close.
- [x] Animations of a gun shot or animated sprite.
- [x] Several levels.
- [x] Sounds and music.
- [x] Rotate the point of view with the mouse.
- [x] Teleports.
